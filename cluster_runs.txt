This file describes how to run the various version 2 scenarios on the
scientific computing platforms at Fred Hutch.

In order to run on either the interactive (rhino) machines of the cluster (gizmo nodes), the following must be in place:

1. Get a rhino account

2. Clone the code from the GIT repository

	ssh [username]@rhino
	git clone https://github.com/FredHutch/COVID_modeling/

3. Make sure you select which R version to load (ml command)

	ex. ml R/3.6.2-foss-2019b-fh1

4. Make sure the required R packages are installed either on the system or locally.

5. CD to the desired run directory

6.  Either launch R interactively or on the cluster

    For running on rhino(01,02 or 03) mahcines...
	run R directly or using "nohup" in background (so you can log off w/o it needing to finish)

    For running on the cluster either use sbatch with a shell script that calls R or normally
    after executing a "grabnode" command.  (Documentation for using both is available on-line).

    
Here are some examples...


Interactive runs...

    cd ~/version2/COVID_modeling/R-script
    ml R/3.6.2-foss-2019b-fh1
    R --vanilla < ../Vaccine\ Rollout/Run_Rollout.R

	or

    nohup R --vanilla < ../Vaccine\ Rollout/Run_Rollout.R > rollout.out &

Batch run (for up to 24 hours)...

    sbatch -n -t 24:00:00 ./run_rollout.sh

where run_rollout.sh is the shell script shown here

#!/bin/sh
Rscript ../Vaccine\ Rollout/Run_Rollout.R

Foreground "grabnode" job...

Use grabnode command to request memory & cpus for some amount of time (must complete by the end of that period)
then issue commands as if you are just on the rhinos.
